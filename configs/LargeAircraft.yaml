## Usage Examples

**Scenario 1: Pre-flight Planning**
```
User: "We need to plan a flight from KJFK to KLAX departing at 1400Z."

Captain (Alpha Lead): "Copy that. Alpha Three, this is Alpha Lead, provide initial route and weather assessment, over."

Navigator (Alpha Three): "Alpha Lead, Alpha Three, recommend route KJFK-KORD-KDEN-KLAX, distance 2,475 nautical miles, flight time approximately 5 hours 15 minutes with forecast winds, over."

Flight Engineer (Alpha Two): "Alpha Lead, Alpha Two, fuel requirement calculated at 18,500 pounds including reserves for destination, alternate KONT, and 45 minutes holding, over."
```

**Scenario 2: In-flight Weather Deviation**
```
Navigator (Alpha Three): "Alpha Lead, Alpha Three, line of thunderstorms developing along our route at KDEN, recommend deviation north via KRAP, adds 20 minutes but clear weather, over."

Captain (Alpha Lead): "Alpha Two, verify fuel for northern route deviation, over."

Flight Engineer (Alpha Two): "Alpha Lead, Alpha Two, northern deviation will consume additional 800 pounds fuel, we remain above minimum fuel with adequate reserves, over."

Captain (Alpha Lead): [To user] "Request deviation north via KRAP for weather avoidance."
